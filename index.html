            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3><i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> What is this course about?</h3>
            <p>
                This course aims to provide an iterative framework for designing real-world machine learning systems. The goal of this framework is to build a system that is deployable, reliable, and scalable.<br><br>

                It starts by considering all stakeholders of each machine learning project and their objectives. Different objectives require different design choices, and this book will discuss the tradeoffs of those choices.<br><br>

                The course covers all the steps from project scoping, data management, model development, deployment, infrastructure, team structure, to business analysis. At each step, it goes over the motivations, challenges, and limitations, if any, of different solutions. The course ends with a discussion on the future of the machine learning production ecosystem.<br><br>

                In the process, students will learn about important issues including privacy, fairness, and security.<br>
            </p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Why machine learning systems design?</h3>
            <p>
                Machine learning systems design is the process of defining the software architecture, infrastructure, algorithms, and data for a machine learning system to satisfy specified requirements.<br><br>

                The tutorial approach has been tremendously successful in getting models off the ground. However, the resulting systems tend to go outdated quickly because (1) the tooling space is being innovated, (2) business requirements change, and (3) data distributions constantly shift. Without an intentional design to hold all the components together, a system will become technical liability, prone to errors and quick to fall apart.
            </p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>Students are expected to have the following background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level sufficient to write a reasonably non-trivial computer program (e.g., CS106B/X or equivalent).</li>
                <li>Good understanding of machine learning algorithms (e.g. at least one of CS229, CS230, CS231N, CS224N or equivalent). </li>
                <li>Familiar with at least one framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX.</li>
                <li>Familiarity with basic probability theory (CS109 or Stat116 or equivalent is sufficient but not necessary). </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Reference Text</h3>
            <p>
                There's no textbook. The course relies on lecture notes and accompanying readings.

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Is this the first time the course is offered?</div>
        <div class="qa">Yes. We're all a little nervous, and we're trying our best to ensure the quality of the lectures, but here and there things might not be as polished as other courses. Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Does the course count towards the AI graduate program?</div>
        <div class="qa">CS 329S can be used as an MSCS elective.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Are lectures recorded?</div>
        <div class="qa">Yes, the lectures will be recorded and made available to enrolled students, including SCPD students.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Is attendance mandatory?</div>
        <div class="qa">We won't be taking attendance but we expect to see you often in class. We love talking to students to understand how you are doing, make sure you get the most out of the class, and get your feedback to improve the materials. The class is relatively small so we will probably get to know each other well.<br>
        If you have a time conflict and can't attend the online lectures, please send us an email to let us know!
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">What is the format of the class?</div>
        <div class="qa">It will be lectures, tutorials, and discussion. We will often have industry experts to give us tutorials on tools for data streaming, experiment tracking, deep learning framework, monitoring, etc.</div>
      </div>
       <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Do I need to know Python for the course?</div>
        <div class="qa">Since Python has become the most popular language for machine learning, we expect most tutorials will be in Python. Python fluency isn't required, but will make your life so much easier during the course.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Can I follow along from the outside?</div>
        <div class="qa">We'd be happy if you join us! All the slides and lecture notes will be posted on this website. You can also subscribe to the <a href="http://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cs329s-win2021-guests">guest mailing list</a> to get updates from the course. </div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Can I audit or sit in?</div>
        <div class="qa">Online teaching has made auditing a bit complicated. If you're interested, please send us an email and we might be able to work something out, but not guaranteed.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">Can I work in groups for the assignments?</div>
        <div class="qa">Yes, in groups of up to two people.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="qqa">
        <div class="qq">I have a question about the class. What is the best way to reach the course staff?</div>
        <div class="qa">Please post your question on the <a href="http://piazza.com/stanford/winter2021/cs329s">course forum</a> so that other students can benefit from your questions. If you have a personal matter or emergencies, please email the staff at cs329s-win2021-staff@lists.stanford.edu.</div>
